These Terms of Service, including any Appendices attached hereto (the \"Terms\") govern your access to and use of NetLynxs (\"we\" or \"our\") websites and services (the \"Services\"), so please carefully read them before using the Services. By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, \"you\" and \"your\" will refer to that organization. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with NetLynxs and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services, including the availability of any feature or content, account access, or any promotion offered by NetLynxs, at any time without prior notice to you.

Of course, some Services, such as the NetLynxs free mobile application, do not have a fee attached to it – but where NetLynxs standard price list sets out a fee, you must pay it to use the Services. Pricing for the various Services types is as described in NetLynxs standard price list – for example, the Services you are using may be billed on a monthly, annual or per-use basis – and billing is based on the accounts created by you. If you are paying by credit card, you authorize NetLynxs or its third-party payment processor to automatically charge your credit card for any and all fees incurred by you for Services. If your credit card is rejected for any reason, you will be responsible for any fees and charges associated with such rejection. The foregoing shall not limit NetLynxs ability to exercise any rights available to it in law or equity respecting the collection of any amounts payable hereunder, and you shall also be responsible for paying for all reasonable fees and costs incurred by NetLynxs, including legal fees, in collecting any overdue amounts or enforcing any provision of these Terms. You are also responsible for paying all taxes applicable to your purchase of the Services."

We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below. By the same token, you’re also responsible for your stuff – you need to ensure that you have the right to provide us with it and to allow us to use your stuff to provide you with the Services and in accordance with these Terms. By using our Services, you agree to take all liability for any claims relating to your stuff, and indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against those claims. We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your information and attachments, or sharing them at your direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews. You agree that, by requesting those services, you’re giving us permission to use your stuff to the extent needed to do the things that you request. We may also need to make design choices to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe, and some of those design choices may require us to move, share or technically manipulate your stuff; however, the integrity and the privacy of your stuff will continue to be respected. You give us the permissions we need to do those technical things solely to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example HostGator, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services). To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won't share your content with others for any purpose unless you direct us to. We comply with all applicable privacy laws respecting our processing and storage of any personal information that may be used in conjunction with the Services, and we deal with your data under these general principles.",

We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that NetLynxs has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services; all of that information is provided “AS IS”, without any warranty at all, and it’s your responsibility to evaluate how and whether you would like to use and rely on the information. In particular, you acknowledge that much of the information is being provided by third parties, who are not under the control or direction of NetLynxs, and NetLynxs is not liable for any acts or omissions of those third parties. Conversely, you agree that you will comply with community guidelines and post, to the best of your ability and where applicable, useful and accurate information"

Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms. We hereby reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms. You must not reverse engineer or decompile the Software, nor attempt to do so, nor assist anyone else to do so. As the Software is solely to be used to access the Services, all parameters for use of the Services also apply to the Software; the Software is also to be used only by you, and you are not permitted to distribute, assign, license, sublicense, lease, rent, transfer, sell or otherwise provide access to the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party on a temporary or permanent basis. Our Services may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available; by continuing to use the Services, you are agreeing that NetLynxs has the right to require you to use those updates, and that those updates are covered under these Terms.\n\nAs we are providing the Software under Canadian law, we need you to comply with certain basic statutory parameters about your rights to use the Software. Accordingly, you hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a Canadian or U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the Canadian or U.S. Governments as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any Canadian or U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\nYou acknowledge that NetLynxs utilizes HostGator to provide hosting for its servers that are used by you in using the Services (“Host”), and that the servers are subject to the hosting agreements of the Host. The Host may impose additional restrictions, or may have additional rights, in relation to your use of the servers; it is solely your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of the terms and conditions imposed by the Host, and to comply with such terms and conditions. As of the date that these Terms were written, such Host’s agreements could be found at HostGator Legal Information (https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/legal-and-acceptable-content).\n\nTo the limited extent that these Terms are less restrictive than the Host’s agreement, or is in direct conflict with, the Host’s agreement as they relate to your obligations respecting use of the servers, the usage rules of the Host’s agreement shall apply. The Host is a third party beneficiary of these Terms, and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, such Host will have the right (and you will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms are concluded solely between you and NetLynxs, and not with the Host, and the Host shall have no responsibility whatsoever respecting the Services or Software."

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and NetLynxs with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services.
